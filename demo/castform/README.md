# Castform Collaboration Demo

Artifacts for planning a Castform collaboration call and demo. These files are
self-contained so the work can be reviewed without touching product code.

Research date: 2026-06-30.

## Files

- `castform-research-brief.md`: what Castform appears to provide, public source
  links, and the observability opportunity for InstantML.
- `demo-plan.md`: call-ready demo story, runbook, fallback path, and success
  criteria.
- `integration-plan.md`: practical integration slices, data mapping, risks, and
  questions for Castform.
- `call-agenda.md`: suggested call structure and discovery questions.
- `castform-metric-mapping.json`: proposed Castform-to-InstantML field and metric
  mapping.
- `castform_instantml_adapter.py`: illustrative pull-sync script using
  Benchmax's public run-read client and the InstantML SDK.
- `seed_castform_demo.py`: deterministic synthetic Castform-shaped data seeder
  for an InstantML demo workspace when live Castform credentials are unavailable.

## Demo Paths

Live mirror path, if we have Castform and InstantML credentials:

```bash
CASTFORM_API_KEY=sk_... \
INSTANTML_API_KEY=instantml_... \
PYTHONPATH=packages/python-sdk \
python3 demo/castform/castform_instantml_adapter.py \
  --castform-run-id <castform-run-id> \
  --instantml-project castform-demo
```

Synthetic fallback path:

```bash
INSTANTML_API_KEY=instantml_... \
PYTHONPATH=packages/python-sdk \
python3 demo/castform/seed_castform_demo.py --project castform-demo --runs 10
```

Both paths are designed to populate InstantML with Castform-shaped run metadata,
reward curves, solve-rate curves, response-length curves, subreward curves,
environment logs, and lifecycle notes so the call can focus on the integration
value instead of credential setup.

## Verification

The scripts are dependency-light but require installed `instantml` and, for the
live mirror path, installed `benchmax` at runtime. Syntax-only verification:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile demo/castform/castform_instantml_adapter.py demo/castform/seed_castform_demo.py
```
